/*
Bubble sort

NOTE: One of the slowest sorts. Mainly just used for teaching purposes.

Algo: compares every two adjacent values and swaps them if the first one is bigger than the second one. Values move up into their correct positions like 'rising bubbles'

Stable: Y
In-place: Y
Comparison-type: Y

Time Complexity

Best: O(n)
Worst: O(n^2)
Average: O((n / 2) * n) = O(n^2 / 2) = O(n^2)

Space Complexity

O(1)
